This means the items in these rules are bought together more often than if they were chosen randomly. I sorted the rules by lift to focus on the strongest relationships. The key metricsâ€”support, confidence, and liftâ€”helped me understand how often items appear together, how reliable the rules are, and how strong the connections are compared to chance.\n","\n","The top 10 rules (from the output in cell 23) are shown below with their metrics:\n","\n","1. **['frozen vegetables', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['spaghetti']**: Support = 0.0126, Confidence = 0.5118, Lift = 2.2299\n","2. **['milk', 'soup'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0124, Confidence = 0.5766, Lift = 1.9229\n","3. **['frozen vegetables', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0133, Confidence = 0.5433, Lift = 1.8120\n","4. **['spaghetti', 'soup'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0108, Confidence = 0.5234, Lift = 1.7454\n","5. **['ground beef', 'pancakes'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0108, Confidence = 0.5185, Lift = 1.7293\n","6. **['chicken', 'chocolate'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0110, Confidence = 0.5182, Lift = 1.7282\n","7. **['olive oil', 'milk'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0124, Confidence = 0.5120, Lift = 1.7075\n","8. **['olive oil', 'chocolate'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0120, Confidence = 0.5082, Lift = 1.6949\n","9. **['milk', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0160, Confidence = 0.5061, Lift = 1.6879\n","10. **['eggs', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['mineral water']**: Support = 0.0145, Confidence = 0.5034, Lift = 1.6787\n","\n","- **Support**: Shows how common the combination is (e.g., 0.0160 means 1.6% of all transactions have both milk and ground beef with mineral water).\n","- **Confidence**: Shows how often the \"then\" item is bought when the \"if\" items are (e.g., 57.66% of transactions with milk and soup also have mineral water).\n","- **Lift**: Shows how much more likely the items are bought together compared to random (e.g., lift of 2.2299 means frozen vegetables and ground beef with spaghetti is 2.23 times more likely than if they were unrelated).\n","\n","#### Interesting Patterns and Relationships\n","From the top rules, I noticed a few clear patterns:\n","\n","1. **Ground Beef as a Key Ingredient**:\n","   - Ground beef appears in four of the top 10 rules (with frozen vegetables, pancakes, milk, and eggs), often leading to mineral water or spaghetti. For example, the rule ['frozen vegetables', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['spaghetti'] has the highest lift (2.2299), meaning these items are strongly linked. Another rule, ['eggs', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['mineral water'], has a decent lift (1.6787). This suggests ground beef is a popular base ingredient that pairs with other foods and drinks.\n","\n","2. **Mineral Water as a Common Add-On**:\n","   - Mineral water is the consequent (the \"then\" part) in nine of the top 10 rules. It pairs with combinations like milk and soup (lift = 1.9229), chicken and chocolate (lift = 1.7282), and olive oil and milk (lift = 1.7075). Its frequent appearance with high confidence (around 50% or more) and lift above 1 shows itâ€™s a staple item customers add to many purchases.\n","\n","3. **Meal Combinations**:\n","   - The rule ['frozen vegetables', 'ground beef'] â†’ ['spaghetti'] (lift = 2.2299) points to a classic meal pattern: ingredients for a dish like spaghetti with meat sauce. Similarly, ['milk', 'soup'] â†’ ['mineral water'] (lift = 1.9229) could indicate soup preparation (milk as an ingredient) paired with a drink. These rules suggest customers are buying items for complete meals.\n","\n","4. **Unexpected Pairings**:\n","   - Some rules, like ['chicken', 'chocolate'] â†’ ['mineral water'] (lift = 1.7282) or ['olive oil', 'chocolate'] â†’ ['mineral water'] (lift = 1.6949), are less obvious. Chicken and chocolate or olive oil and chocolate donâ€™t seem like natural meal pairs, but their link to mineral water suggests customers might be grabbing a drink with diverse shopping baskets.\n","\n","#### Insights into Customer Purchasing Behavior\n","Based on these patterns, here are some insights into how customers shop:\n","\n","1. **Meal Planning**:\n","   - Customers often buy ingredients for specific meals. The strong link between frozen vegetables, ground beef, and spaghetti (lift = 2.2299) shows theyâ€™re likely making dishes like spaghetti bolognese. Stores could bundle these items or place them closer together to encourage more sales.\n","\n","2. **Mineral Water Popularity**:\n","   - Mineral waterâ€™s dominance in the rules (e.g., confidence of 57.66% with milk and soup) suggests itâ€™s a go-to beverage for many customers, no matter what else theyâ€™re buying. This could mean itâ€™s a habit or a healthy choice they add to every trip. Retailers might promote it as a complementary item with meal ingredients.\n","\n","3. **Versatile Ingredients**:\n","   - Ground beefâ€™s frequent appearance (e.g., with eggs, pancakes, or milk, all leading to mineral water) shows itâ€™s a versatile ingredient in many customersâ€™ diets. They might use it for burgers, pasta, or breakfast dishes. Offering ground beef promotions with related items (like eggs or spaghetti) could boost sales.\n","\n","4. **Mix of Healthy and Indulgent Choices**:\n","   - Rules like ['olive oil', 'milk'] â†’ ['mineral water'] (lift = 1.7075) suggest healthier shopping (olive oil and milk are cooking staples), while ['chicken', 'chocolate'] â†’ ['mineral water'] mixes a protein with a treat. This shows customers balance nutrition and indulgence, often rounding out their carts with mineral water.\n","\n","#### Conclusion\n","The association rules reveal that customers tend to shop for meal components (like ground beef and spaghetti) and frequently add mineral water as a staple. The high lift values, especially for rules involving ground beef and spaghetti or milk and soup, highlight strong product relationships that arenâ€™t random. These insights could help the store improve product placement (e.g., putting mineral water near ground beef or soup), create bundle deals, or target promotions to match these buying habits. Overall, the rules show a mix of practical meal planning and consistent beverage preferences in customer behavior.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Ci5V8O219Krm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","\n","## Interpret the Results and Provide Insights into Customer Purchasing Behaviour\n","\n","The association rules from the \"Online retail.xlsx\" dataset reveal clear patterns in how customers shop. Based on the discovered rules, hereâ€™s what they tell us about purchasing behavior:\n","\n","1. **Meal Preparation Drives Purchases**:\n","   - The rule `{frozen vegetables, ground beef} â†’ {spaghetti}` shows customers often buy these items together. This suggests theyâ€™re planning meals like spaghetti with meat sauce, combining a protein (ground beef), a vegetable, and a staple (spaghetti). Itâ€™s a sign of intentional cooking at home, likely for family or quick dinners.\n","\n","2. **Mineral Water as a Go-To Add-On**:\n","   - Rules like `{milk, soup} â†’ {mineral water}`, `{chicken, chocolate} â†’ {mineral water}`, and `{olive oil, milk} â†’ {mineral water}` highlight mineral waterâ€™s frequent appearance. Customers add it to their carts no matter what else theyâ€™re buyingâ€”whether itâ€™s soup ingredients or a mix of chicken and chocolate. This points to a habit of grabbing a drink, possibly for hydration or health reasons, alongside their main items.\n","\n","3. **Ground Beefâ€™s Versatility**:\n","   - Ground beef shows up in multiple rules, such as `{eggs, ground beef} â†’ {mineral water}` and `{milk, ground beef} â†’ {mineral water}`. This suggests customers use it in various waysâ€”maybe for breakfast (with eggs), pasta (with spaghetti), or other dishes (with milk). Itâ€™s a flexible ingredient in their diets, often paired with a drink like mineral water.\n","\n","4. **Mix of Practical and Surprising Choices**:\n","   - Rules like `{chicken, chocolate} â†’ {mineral water}` and `{olive oil, chocolate} â†’ {mineral water}` are unexpected. Chicken and chocolate or olive oil and chocolate donâ€™t naturally go together, but customers still buy them with mineral water. This could mean theyâ€™re shopping for different needs in one tripâ€”protein for meals, chocolate as a treatâ€”while adding a consistent beverage.\n","\n","5. **Health and Convenience Blend**:\n","   - Combinations like `{olive oil, milk} â†’ {mineral water}` or `{frozen vegetables, ground beef} â†’ {mineral water}` suggest a balance. Olive oil and frozen vegetables hint at healthier cooking, while ground beef and milk are everyday staples. Customers seem to mix nutritious choices with convenient, familiar items, often rounding out their baskets with mineral water.\n","\n","#### Insights into Customer Purchasing Behaviour\n","- **Home Cooking Focus**: Customers are buying ingredients (ground beef, spaghetti, eggs) for complete meals, showing they cook regularly and plan ahead. Stores could offer recipe ideas or meal kits to match this habit.\n","- **Staple Beverage Preference**: Mineral waterâ€™s constant presence suggests itâ€™s a must-have for many, whether theyâ€™re cooking or just snacking. Retailers might boost sales by placing it near popular items like milk or ground beef.\n","- **Flexible Shopping Trips**: The varietyâ€”health-focused items (olive oil) with treats (chocolate)â€”shows customers shop for multiple purposes at once. Promotions could target this by bundling meal essentials with small indulgences.\n","- **Practical Shoppers**: Frequent pairings like milk, eggs, and ground beef with mineral water indicate practical, routine purchases. Stores can make these items easy to grab together to encourage bigger carts.\n","\n","In short, customers are practical, meal-focused shoppers who value staples like mineral water and versatile ingredients like ground beef, blending health and convenience in their buying habits.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"v1Ow3pnP9xjF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["___\n","# **Interview Questions**\n","\n","## **1.
